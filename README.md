Code example:
```
#there are two ways to declare variable: keyword 'var' and with '_' as first character of variable's name
var name1 = "John'
var age1 = 18
_name2 = "Jane"
_age2 = 21

#two ways to declare function: keyword 'fun' and ':' as first character of function's name
fun info(name_1, age_1, name_2, age_2){
  println("First person: ", name_1, age_1)
  println("Second person: ", name_2, age_2)
}

info(name1, age1, name2, age2)

:second_info(name_1, name_2){
  println(name_1, name_2)
}
 
 second_info(name1, name2)
```
